# Morse-Parser
Low level Arduino Morse code input and parser

## Description
Morse data is input by the user via a button. An OLED 128x64 I2C display is used to display the alphabetical representation of the Morse code. Currently, only alphabet characters are supported. However, more can be defined in the header `morse.h` file.
